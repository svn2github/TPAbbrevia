   Finds all files that have their Tagged property set to<I> </I>True 
   and marks them to be freshened.</P>
  <P>
   The next time the archive is saved, all marked files are freshened. 
   If the file is found on the disk and it has been modified since it 
   was last stored in the archive, the compressed data in the archive is 
   replaced with the compressed representation of the current file.</P>
  <P>
   The directories that are searched to find the file depend on the 
   StoreOptions and BaseDirectory properties. See the table in 
   FreshenFiles for details of determining the directory to search.</P>
  <P>
   See the TagItems method of the TAbBaseBrowser class in the printed 
   documentation for information about how tagging works.</P>
  <P>
   See the OnProcessItemFailure event of the TAbBaseBrowser class in the 
   printed documentation for a description of the exceptions that can 
   occur during the freshen process.</P>
