   Low-level Deflate Compression</H1>

  <P>
   For its Zip, ZLib, and GZip support, Abbrevia uses its own 
   implementations of the standard Deflate or Deflate64 algorithms to 
   compress data. To enable wider applicability and use of these 
   algorithms, the low-level compression and decompression routines are 
   interfaced and documented.</P>
  <P>
   The Deflate routine compresses a source stream and writes it to 
   another stream; the second decompresses a source stream into another. 
   Using these routines you can compress and decompress arbitrary 
   streams, without having to use the standard Zip, ZLib or GZip formats.</P>
  <P>
   The two routines take an instance of a special class, 
   TAbDeflateHelper, to define the options for both compression and decompression.
