   Default: '' (Windows); Current User's Group Name (Linux)</P>
  <P>
   Indicates the Unix file system &quot;Group Name&quot; for the 
   archived file.</P>
  <P>
   The standard Unix file system (which is also used by Linux) includes 
   the notion of a user group to which a file belongs. Such groups can 
   have symbolic names associated with them (e.g. &quot;USERS&quot;). 
   The GroupName property supplies this value for a Tar item.</P>
  <P>
   When extracting files on Windows this value is provided but is 
   otherwise ignored. On Linux the GroupID property is used to determine 
   the group that the extracted file is assigned to. Abbrevia does not 
   ensure that the stored GroupID and GroupName match according to the 
   file system. The programmer has the option and opportunity to perform 
   such checks in the OnProcessItem event of a TAbArchive descendant.</P>
  <P>
   When compressing files, changing this value from the default causes 
   the value to be stored with the file as the Group Name, but has no 
   other effect on the archiving process. In particular Abbrevia does 
   not ensure that the value set to GroupName corresponds to that 
   associated with the GroupID property according to the Linux file system.</P>
