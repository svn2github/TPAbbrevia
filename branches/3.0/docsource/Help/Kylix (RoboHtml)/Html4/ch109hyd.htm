   Specifies the referent entity for link file system entities.</P>
  <P>
   The standard Unix file system (which is also used by Linux) makes use 
   of a number of different types of file system entries that may be 
   stored in a Tar archive. Some of these may not have any actual stored 
   data associated with them, but rather serve to describe the logical 
   structure of the file system.</P>
  <P>
   File system links serve as aliases for other file system entities. 
   When such a link is stored in a Tar, the name of its referent is also 
   stored which is represented in Abbrevia by the LinkName property.</P>
